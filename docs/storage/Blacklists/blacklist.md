## Flights

#### "Kiss & Fly" 💀💀💀

 - Booked a flight 48h before departure, didn't get a confirmation for
   the next 26h.  Impossible to plan, pack, or book a train to the
   airport.  I expect they'll either not "accept my offer" or they'll
   propose I buy it for 2× the amount, in either case, this has ruined
   my ability to arrive at my destination with at a reasonable cost.

   If they accept my booking later than 4h before departure, I'll have
   to sue them.  I'll win, but it's a pain in the ass.

#### Kiwi.com  👎👎👎
 - They don't give you your booking code (Buchungsreferenz) so you
   cannot check in by yourself.  Instead, they force you to download
   their app.

   Correction: The booking code is buried deep in one of the PDFs.
   Now I already filled in my information for Check-In -- which the
   fineprint says costs extra money.  This is basically **fraud**.


## Internet WiFi Routers

### Zyxel
 - ... has no plans to release patches for two zero-days under attack
   and is advising customers to replace vulnerable routers.  The
   company says these devices have been “EOL for years” -- but the
   devices are not on Zyxel’s EOL page, and some are still available
   to buy.   techcrunch.com Feb 5, 2025
